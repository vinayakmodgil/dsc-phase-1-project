## Overview
This is a project that uses Exploratory Data Analysis to help help Microsoft make decisions based on what movies to produce on their brand new venture Microsoft Movie Studio.

## Business Problem
Venturing into the movie market, Microsoft has a choice of making original video content just like Netflix and Hulu does. As a beginner in this industry, Microsoft needs to find out the recent trends in the movie industry, and the popularity of movies as seen on IMDB, Rotten Tomotoes and TMDB. The solution is to analyse the data and help the head of Microsoft’s new movie studio to make business decisions.

## Data
The data is selected from IMDB, TMDB, TN and Rotten tomatoes. The dataset contains over 650 movies and the data ranges from genres to worldwide gross.

## Methods
This project uses descriptive analysis, including description of trends over time. This provides a useful overview of movies from 2014 to 2019.

## Results
The most popular genres are Sci-Fi follwed by Animation and Adventure.

## Conclusions 
#### This analysis leads to three recommendations for producing original video content:
1.) Microsoft needs to invest in media companies that make content in Sci-Fi, Animation and Adventure. 
2.) As seen from the trends, usually long movies are more popular and therefore Microsoft should focus on the same.
 3.) Movies with high rating doesn't necessarily amount to the return on investment being high. As we can see, medium rated films perform better than others in terms of ROI.

## Next Steps:
The following steps recommended are:
1.) Improve production speed by investing more in genre-specific studios.
2.) Aim for high return on investment which is usually seen from medium rated movies.
3.) Allocate high budgets to movies
